#### A Gmail search & drafting extension powered by LLMs.

Mojave is an experimental project to integrate LLM powered search and drafting capabilities to the popular email service. 

The names Mojave and TheCourier were inspired from the popular RPG, Fallout: New Vegas. A game whose opening sequence left quite an imprint on my adolescent mind.
